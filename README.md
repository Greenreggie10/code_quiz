## !-- Setup -->

The challenge was to build a coding quiz game from scratch. With no starter code given, I was asked to use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop a game where the user starts the game and is presented with questions until either all are answered or a timer hits zero, at which point the game will provide the user with their score and give them the ability to store that score and their initials in a leaderboard. The game includes the following additional features:


## !-- Tools Usage  -->        

The website is built and developed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code).


HTML was used to create the website's content.


CSS styled and formated the quiz.


JavaScript was used to dynamically loop through questions and match answer selections against correct answers.


Github hosts the repo.
